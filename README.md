# Vite + Express Server Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite, with server-side rendering via ViteExpress.

Running `npm run dev_server` will create a live dev environment to work in, while `npm run server` will build and run prod.

This template also includes `nodemon` and `sass`.

# To use: 

- Clone repo
- run `npm i`
- Change title in index.html
- Start either the `dev` or `prod` environment
- Enjoy
